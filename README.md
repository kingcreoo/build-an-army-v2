# build-an-army
 
Build an army is a simple, easy, aesthetically pleasing ROBLOX game. It is a kind of Tycoon game almost similiar to Grow a garden! The player has a team of soldiers that destroy targets endlessly without the push of a button & even work when the player is offline.

## The core gameplay loop: 

The player has a plot of land with a group of soldiers that are ever-firing at a group of targets across from them. When the soldiers kill a target the player is rewarded with credits. With credits the player can purchase or upgrade soldiers & unlock new targets with higher rewards.

## Full feature idea list (to be referenced as a far reaching 'dreams' for the game):

1. The game has a central baseplate with shops and items that aren't specific to a player in the center. Each player gets their own plot on the baseplate that displays their soldiers.
2. Players can manage their soldier lineup through a GUI.
3. Players can purchase new soldiers directly at the barracks located in the center of the baseplate.
4. Players can upgrade their soldier's stats at the armory located in the center of the baseplate.
5. Players can unlock new targets at the target shop located in the center of the baseplate.
6. Players can rebirth after completing a portion of the game & earn rebirth tokens that can be used to purchase strong multipliers or special soldiers.
7. Players can purchase pets that act as multipliers or offer some kind of boost.
8. Players can purchase or earn 'boosts' that will temporarily boost the effectiveness of their team of soldiers.
9. Players can grow a 'boost tree' on their plot that will drop boosts that automatically apply after 'growing' on the tree.

## References:

Soldiers should be lined up in an exact row almost like an execution squad.
There are 'slots' for the soldier (the player can control which soldier is in each slot).
Soldier in 'slot1' always fires at the target in 'slot1' and never any other target, the same for every other soldier.

Code can be used from the second directly 'shoot the enemy' which was a prior game idea, but could have valuable code that's already written and could be applied here.
